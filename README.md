# Parallel-P-threads-2D-grid
A simple program to demonstrate the power of parallel computing using pthreads. The program uses four pthreads to compute a 2D grid of numbers and outputs the time elapsed from the computation method.
This was done as a school project for the parallel & cluster computing course.
